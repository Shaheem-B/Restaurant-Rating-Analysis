ðŸ“Œ Objective :
    This project aims to analyze a restaurant dataset to extract meaningful insights using data 
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), geospatial visualization, and machine learning models.
The primary objectives include:
âœ… Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset for analysis. 
âœ… Exploring statistical patterns in restaurant data. 
âœ… Understanding customer behavior through rating analysis. 
âœ… Predicting restaurant ratings using machine learning models. 
âœ… Identifying geospatial trends and business insights.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview :
1) The dataset contains information about restaurants, including:
2) Restaurant Name
3) Location Details (City, Country, Latitude, Longitude)
4) Cuisines Offered
5) Price Range
6) Ratings & Reviews
7) Online Delivery & Table Booking Availability

ðŸ“Œ Project Milestones :
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Handled missing values, transformed data types, and performed feature engineering.
âœ… Descriptive Analysis â€“ Analyzed cuisines, restaurant locations, and price categories.
âœ… Geospatial Visualization â€“ Mapped restaurant density and rating distributions across regions.
âœ… Predictive Modeling â€“ Built ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict restaurant ratings.
âœ… Customer Behavior Insights â€“ Examined how table booking, online delivery, and pricing impact ratings.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used :
ðŸ”¹ Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
ðŸ”¹ Geospatial Tools: Folium & Geopandas
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
ðŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

ðŸ“Œ Major Insights :
âœ… Restaurants offering online delivery & table booking tend to have higher ratings.
âœ… Mid-range price restaurants receive better ratings than extremely low or high-end ones.
âœ… Certain cuisines (e.g., Italian, Japanese) are consistently rated higher.
âœ… Restaurant locations significantly impact customer preferences and rating trends.
